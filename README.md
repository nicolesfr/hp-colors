This repository contains the Color Dictionary developed for the analysis of color symbolism and narrative functions in the Harry Potter series. The dataset was created as part of a thesis that applies computational methods from the Digital Humanities to study color references in both the literary and cinematic adaptations.

The dictionary is structured into two main datasets:

Expanded Color Dictionary via WordNet â€“ A lexicon of color-related terms automatically enriched with synonyms and semantically related words.
Manually Extracted Color Terms â€“ A curated list of color-related words and multiword expressions manually identified in the raw text.
ðŸ“‚ Contents
expanded_colors.csv â€“ Contains the WordNet-expanded color dictionary.
manual_colors.csv â€“ Includes manually extracted color terms and phrases.
ðŸ“Œ Usage
This dataset can be used for computational text analysis, linguistic research, and symbolic color studies in literary and transmedia narratives. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in natural language processing (NLP), color theory, and adaptation studies.
